# Diabetes Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis and prediction of diabetes using a dataset containing various health metrics. The primary goal is to build a predictive model that can classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on their health data. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this analysis is named `diabetes.csv`. It includes several features that may be indicative of diabetes.

### Key Features
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)

## Steps and Methodology

1. **Data Import and Libraries**:
   - Libraries used include Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost.

2. **Data Loading and Initial Analysis**:
   - The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and initial exploration is conducted to understand the data structure, including the shape, head of the dataset, and statistical measures.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Although not explicitly mentioned, the dataset is checked for any missing values.
   - **Feature Standardization**: StandardScaler from Scikit-learn is used to standardize the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

4. **Data Splitting**:
   - The data is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split ratio.

5. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Various classification algorithms are considered, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Neighbors, XGBoost, and Naive Bayes.
   - **Chosen Model**: Logistic Regression is selected for the final model due to its suitability for binary classification tasks.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated using a confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score. Both training and testing accuracy are reported.

7. **Predictive System**:
   - A system is built to predict diabetes status based on input data, demonstrating the practical application of the trained model.

## Conclusion

The project successfully builds a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis. Logistic Regression is identified as an effective classifier for this binary classification problem, providing good accuracy and interpretability.

## Requirements

The analysis requires the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed.
2. Load the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.
